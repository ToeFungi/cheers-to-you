# Lets Toast

A multilingual toasting application. Giving a random language to toast in with a simple click of a button with languages including Russian, Japanese, Korean,
 French, Greek... Even Czech! Toast a fresh round of drinks with a foreign language to impress your friends or the crowd standing next to you at the bar!

This isn't designed to run on a web browser. It's supposed to be used in conjunction with Apache Cordova to generate an APK.
